# FlappyBird-Override
This is a basic Flappy Bird game clone made using Pygame.

📌 About
I followed the GeeksforGeeks tutorial to build this project. The purpose of making this game was not originality or creativity, but simply to understand the core logic behind how Flappy Bird works—including gravity, pipe generation, collision detection, and game loops in Pygame.

🧠 What I Learned
How to use Pygame for 2D game development

Game physics (gravity, velocity, jump mechanics)

Random obstacle (pipe) generation

Handling collisions and scoring

Managing game states (start screen, gameplay, game over)

🔧 Requirements
Python 
Pygame

To install Pygame, run:

pip install pygame

▶️ How to Run:
python flappy_bird.py
